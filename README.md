IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIORITY SCHEDULING ALGORITHM AIM
To write a C program to implement Priority Scheduling algorithm.
DESCRIPTION:
For priority scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system,
their CPU burst times, and the priorities. Arrange all the jobs in order with respect to their priorities.
There may be two jobs in queue with the same priority, and then FCFS approach is to be performed. 
Each process will be executed according to its priority. Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time of each 
of the processes accordingly.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Get the input process and their burst time. 
Step 3: Sort the processes based on priority.
Step 4: Compute the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. 
Step 5: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time. 
Step 6: Print the details about all the processes.
Step 7: Stop the program.
